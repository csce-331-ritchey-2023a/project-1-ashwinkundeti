                During the summer of 2018, I would go to the Resale store of Habitat for Humanity and I would volunteer
                during the day helping move furniture around the store and assembling donated furniture in the back. I would
                also help move furniture into customers' cars. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/">Link</a>

            <p>
                During the summer of 2019, I would volunteer at the Frisco Food Pantry and Frisco Resale store. At the food 
                pantry I would help with picking up donations at stores and cleaning up the store when some of the food has
                expired. In the resale store, I would pick out unnecessary items and also help move items in and out of
                customers' cars. <a href="https://friscofamilyservices.org/">Link</a>
