            <h2>SC22 Student Cluster Competition</h2>
            <img id="sclogo" src="sc22.png" alt="SC22 logo">
            <p>
                Over the Spring Semester, I prepared for the student cluster competition which A&M was selected for and competed in November.
                It's a 48 hour competition that occurs annually at the SC conference which was in Dallas for 2022.
                It involved each of the selected teams to bring a cluster and compete in a series of benchmarks and 
                it also tested our ability to run programs such as PHASTA (a Navier Stokes Equation Solver), LAMMPS (a molecular dynamics simulator),
                an earthquake simulating mystery program, a reproducability challenge involving dace with Python, 
                and other programs. I worked with the HPCG benchmark and PHASTA. I optimized the values that 
                produced the best results with the hardware we had. <a href="https://sc22.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/">Link</a>

            <h2>Amazon Spend Analyzer</h2>
            <img id="amazon" src="amazon.png" alt="Amazon logo">
            <p>
                During the Winter Break of sophomore year, I wanted to work on a project to add to my github profile and found this as an example.
                I worked with data which a customer can download from the Amazon website and this program would take that data and find the most
                expensive item, least expensive item, and average cost of what you spent over the time period specified. <a href="https://github.com/ashwin-k22/projects/blob/main/amazon_data_analyzer.py">Link</a>

            <h2>Random Password Generator</h2>
            <img id="dice" src="dice.jpg" alt="dice">
            <p>
                During the same winter break of sophomore year, I also worked on this simple random password generator. All the user has to specify is 
                the number of passwords they want and how many characters the password should be. I made sure to have a good mix of uppercase characters, lowercase characters, and symbols so it passes requirements websites usually impose.It was a fun simple project. <a href="https://github.com/ashwin-k22/projects/blob/main/random_password_generator.py">Link</a>

            <h2>Business Case</h2>
            <img id="compost" src="compost.jpg" alt="compost">
            <p>
                During the summer of 2021, I was hired by an entrepreneur to create a business case for a potential composting company. As part of the business case, 
                I researched and analyzed similar existing businesses, marketing opportunities, competition, startup/operating costs, 
                conducted surveys, and personally engaged in conversation with similar existing businesses. It was a good experience and I learned about the feasilibilty of a business proposal
